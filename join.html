        The SF Bay ISSA Chapter is always looking for great presenters. If you
        or your company have a presentation or a topic of interest, please
        contact vicepresident@sfbay.issa.org with the proposed title, abstract,
        and speaker biography. The presentation cannot be a "sales/product
        pitch." However, it is okay for the speaker to take a minute or two to
        establish their expertise in the area and the company at which they
        work." The presentation should last no more than 45 minutes excluding a
        10-15 minute question and answer session.
